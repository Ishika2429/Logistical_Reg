# Week 5b Logistic Regression Tutorial
This repository provides the Jupyter Notebook used in the Week 5b Logistic Regression course. The lesson delves into the essential concepts, implementation, and evaluation of logistic regression in data science.
<hr/>

# Features
1. Introduction to Logistic Regression: Understand the theory and applications of logistic regression.
2. Hands-on Implementation: Learn to code in Python by following along with popular libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
3. Model evaluation: Model evaluationincludes measurements such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC for assessing model performance.

<hr/>

# Breakdown of Tests
1. Data Validation Tests:
<li>Confirms the absence of missing or corrupted data.</li>
<li>Ensures that data is in a format suitable for modeling.</li>
2. Model Performance Tests:
<li>Calculates crucial measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.</li>
<li>Creates a Confusion Matrix to visualize classification results.</li>
3. Visualization Tests:
<li>Plots the ROC-AUC curve to determine the model's discriminating power.</li>

# Deployment
This project is designed for local execution in a development environment. However, the methods and insights can be expanded to deploy machine learning models on platforms such as:
<li>AWS SageMaker</li>
<li>Google Cloud AI</li>
<li>Heroku</li>
Steps for deployment:
<li>Convert the trained model to a deployable format</li>
<li>Integrate with APIs or web apps to get real-time predictions.</li>
<hr/>

# Usage
This tutorial is intended for students and professionals seeking a practical introduction to Logistic Regression. By following the steps in the notebook, you'll learn how to:
<li>Prepare data for modeling.</li>
<li>Implement logistic regression in Python.</li>
<li>Interpret the results and evaluate the model.</li>
